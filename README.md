# playlist_adapter

When I migrated my playlists from AudioStation (Synology) to Jellyfin, I had tons of playlist and more than 10k songs to migrate. AudioStation stores playlist data as text whereas Jellyfin stores as xml.

This project can be used to adapt multiple playlists at once using Java Threading.
